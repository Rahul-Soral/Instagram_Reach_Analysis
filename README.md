# Instagram_Reach_Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Instagram reach data using Python. The project explores how different sources (Home, Hashtags, Explore) impact Instagram impressions and engagement metrics. It includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, statistical correlation, predictive modeling, and visualization.

# Key Contributions:
1. Data Preprocessing:
- Loaded and examined Instagram data using Pandas, addressing missing values and data types to ensure clean data for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualized the distribution of impressions from different sources (Home, Hashtags, Explore) using histograms and pie charts.
- Created word clouds to analyze the most frequent terms in captions and hashtags, providing insights into content trends.
3. Correlation Analysis:
- Calculated the correlation matrix to explore relationships between Impressions and other numerical features.
- Identified key metrics influencing impressions, such as Likes, Shares, and Saves.
4. Predictive Modeling:
- Implemented a PassiveAggressiveRegressor model to predict Impressions based on features like Likes, Saves, Comments, Shares, Profile Visits, and Follows.
- Evaluated model performance with a test set and achieved an accuracy score, demonstrating the model's effectiveness.
5. Performance Metrics:
- Calculated conversion rates (Follows per Profile Visit) to assess the efficiency of user engagement.
- Developed scatter plots with trendlines to visualize relationships between impressions and engagement metrics (Likes, Comments, Shares, Saves).
6. Visualization & Reporting:
- Generated comprehensive visualizations including distribution plots, pie charts, scatter plots, and word clouds to present insights effectively.
- Presented findings and recommendations based on data analysis to enhance Instagram content strategy and engagement.
  
# Achievements:
